## 🏊 What is a Piscine?

A **piscine** (French for "swimming pool") is an intensive learning experience divided into many small, daily modules. Each day introduces a new topic in the chosen domain — here, **cybersecurity**.

Much like the selection piscine at 42, this one requires serious time and effort. It's not possible to validate the piscine with just one or two finished modules.

### ✅ Piscine Validation Requirements

- **Daily commitment** is essential — try to submit work each day, even if unfinished.
- **Two weeks minimum** of active work is expected.
- **Each module** must be submitted within a day of being initialized.
- **Peer-evaluations**: You must complete 2 peer-evaluations per module within 2 days.
- **Retrying is allowed** immediately after a failed attempt.
- **Teamwork** is highly encouraged. Don’t go through the piscine alone!

To successfully complete this piscine, you must validate the following projects in this exact order:

1. **Cybersecurity - arachnida** (Web)

## 📌 Notes

- Stay organized: keep track of deadlines and peer evaluations.
- Use GitHub and write documentation for each project — it helps you, your peers, and recruiters.
- Don’t hesitate to collaborate and review others' work — teaching is a powerful way to learn.

Good luck and stay curious! 🧠🔍
